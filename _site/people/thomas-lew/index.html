	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> We revisit the sample average approximation (SAA) approach for general non-convex stochastic programming. We show that applying the SAA approach to problems with expected value equality constraints does not necessarily result in asymptotic optimality guarantees as the number of samples increases. To address this issue, we relax the equality constraints. Then, we prove the asymptotic optimality of the modified SAA approach under mild smoothness and boundedness conditions on the equality constraint functions. Our analysis uses random set theory and concentration inequalities to characterize the approximation error from the sampling procedure. We apply our approach to the problem of stochastic optimal control for nonlinear dynamical systems subject to external disturbances modeled by a Wiener process. We verify our approach on a rocket-powered descent problem and show that our computed solutions allow for significant uncertainty reduction.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Robust motion planning entails computing a global motion plan that is safe under all possible uncertainty realizations, be it in the system dynamics, the robot’s initial position, or with respect to external disturbances. Current approaches for robust motion planning either lack theoretical guarantees, or make restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty distributions. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing the robust rapidly-exploring random-tree (Robust-RRT) algorithm, which integrates forward reachability analysis directly into sampling-based control trajectory synthesis. We prove that Robust-RRT is probabilistically complete (PC) for nonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with bounded uncertainty. In other words, Robust-RRT eventually finds a robust motion plan that is feasible under all possible uncertainty realizations assuming such a plan exists. Our analysis applies even to unstable systems that admit only short-horizon feasible plans; this is because we explicitly consider the time evolution of reachable sets along control trajectories. Thanks to the explicit consideration of time dependency in our analysis, PC applies to unstabilizable systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most general PC proof for robust sampling-based motion planning, in terms of the types of uncertainties and dynamical systems it can handle. Considering that an exact computation of reachable sets can be computationally expensive for some dynamical systems, we incorporate sampling-based reachability analysis into Robust-RRT and demonstrate our robust planner on nonlinear, underactuated, and hybrid systems.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> We present a data-driven algorithm for efficiently computing stochastic control policies for general joint chance constrained optimal control problems. Our approach leverages the theory of kernel distribution embeddings, which allows representing expectation operators as inner products in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This framework enables approximately reformulating the original problem using a dataset of observed trajectories from the system without imposing prior assumptions on the parameterization of the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty. By optimizing over a finite subset of stochastic open-loop control trajectories, we relax the original problem to a linear program over the control parameters that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our proposed approach in simulation on a system with nonlinear non-Markovian dynamics navigating in a cluttered environment.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> In this work, we analyze an efficient sampling-based algorithm for general-purpose reachability analysis, which remains a notoriously challenging problem with applications ranging from neural network verification to safety analysis of dynamical systems. By sampling inputs, evaluating their images in the true reachable set, and taking their ε-padded convex hull as a set estimator, this algorithm applies to general problem settings and is simple to implement. Our main contribution is the derivation of asymptotic and finite-sample accuracy guarantees using random set theory. This analysis informs algorithmic design to obtain an ε-close reachable set approximation with high probability, provides insights into which reachability problems are most challenging, and motivates safety-critical applications of the technique. On a neural network verification task, we show that this approach is more accurate and significantly faster than prior work. Informed by our analysis, we also design a robust model predictive controller that we demonstrate in hardware experiments.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> To safely deploy learning-based systems in highly uncertain environments, one must ensure that they always satisfy constraints. In this work, we propose a practical and theoretically justified approach to maintaining safety in the presence of dynamics uncertainty. Our approach leverages Bayesian meta-learning with last-layer adaptation: the expressiveness of neural-network features trained offline, paired with efficient last-layer online adaptation, enables the derivation of tight confidence sets which contract around the true dynamics as the model adapts online. We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics uncertainty where reaching the goal safely is initially infeasible by first exploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting the acquired information to safely perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework provides safety guarantees in the form of a single joint chance constraint. Furthermore, we use this theoretical analysis to motivate regularization of the model to improve performance. We extensively demonstrate our approach in simulation and on hardware.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Reliable and efficient trajectory generation methods are a fundamental need for autonomous dynamical systems of tomorrow. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive tutorial of three major convex optimization-based trajectory generation methods:  lossless convexification (LCvx), and two sequential convex programming algorithms known as SCvx and GuSTO. In this article, trajectory generation is the computation of a dynamically feasible state and control signal that satisfies a set of constraints while optimizing key mission objectives.  The trajectory generation problem is almost always nonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient and reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle.  The three algorithms that we discuss use problem reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to nonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a convex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational speed offered by convex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and industry circles.  To date, the list of applications include rocket landing, spacecraft hypersonic reentry, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion planning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles, robot motion planning, and more.  Among these applications are high-profile rocket flights conducted by organizations like NASA, Masten Space Systems, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. This article aims to give the reader the tools and understanding necessary to work with each algorithm, and to know what each method can and cannot do. A publicly available source code repository supports the numerical examples provided at the end of this article. By the end of the article, the reader should be ready to use each method, to extend them, and to contribute to their many exciting modern applications.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> When testing conditions differ from those represented in training data, so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs can mar the reliability of “black-box�? learned components in the modern robotic autonomy stack. Therefore, coping with OOD data is an important challenge on the path towards reliable learning-enabled open-world autonomy. In this paper, we aim to demystify the topic of OOD data and associated challenges in the context of data-driven robotic systems, drawing connections to emerging paradigms in the ML community that study the effect of OOD data on learned models in isolation. We argue that as roboticists, we should reason about the overall system-level competence of a robot as it performs tasks in OOD conditions. We highlight key research questions around this system-level view of OOD problems to guide future research toward safe and reliable learning-enabled autonomy.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Tractable safety-ensuring algorithms for cyber-physical systems are important in critical applications. Approaches based on Control Barrier Functions assume continuous enforcement, which is not possible in an online fashion. This paper presents two tractable algorithms to ensure forward invariance of discrete-time controlled cyber-physical systems. Both approaches are based on Control Barrier Functions to provide strict mathematical safety guarantees. The first algorithm exploits Lipschitz continuity and formulates the safety condition as a robust program which is subsequently relaxed to a set of affine conditions. The second algorithm is inspired by tube-NMPC and uses an affine Control Barrier Function formulation in conjunction with an auxiliary controller to guarantee safety of the system. We combine an approximate NMPC controller with the second algorithm to guarantee strict safety despite approximated constraints and show its effectiveness experimentally on a mini-Segway.</p>

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Reachability analysis is at the core of many applications, from neural network verification, to safe trajectory planning of uncertain systems. However, this problem is notoriously challenging, and current approaches tend to be either too restrictive, too slow, too conservative, or approximate and therefore lack guarantees. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sampling-based approach to perform reachability analysis for arbitrary dynamical systems. Our key novel idea consists of using random set theory to give a rigorous interpretation of our method, and prove that it returns sets which are guaranteed to converge to the convex hull of the true reachable sets. Additionally, we leverage recent work on robust deep learning and propose a new adversarial sampling approach to robustify our algorithm and accelerate its convergence. We demonstrate that our method is faster and less conservative than prior work, present results for approximate reachability analysis of neural networks and robust trajectory optimization of high-dimensional uncertain nonlinear systems, and discuss future applications.</p>

Specifically, leveraging a dataset of expert trajectories from GuSTO, we devise a neural-network-based approach to predict a locally optimal state and control trajectory, which is used to warm-start the SCP algorithm.

	<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) has recently gain popularity as a tool for trajectory optimization, due to its sound theoretical properties and practical performance. Yet, most SCP-based methods for trajectory optimization are restricted to Euclidean settings, which precludes their application to problem instances where one needs to reason about manifold-type constraints (that is, constraints, such as loop closure, which restrict the motion of a system to a subset of the ambient space). The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by extending SCP-based trajectory optimization methods to a manifold setting. The key insight is to leverage geometric embeddings to lift a manifold-constrained trajectory optimization problem into an equivalent problem defined over a space enjoying Euclidean structure. This insight allows one to extend existing SCP methods to a manifold setting in a fairly natural way. In particular, we present an SCP algorithm for manifold problems with theoretical guarantees that resemble those derived for the Euclidean setting, and demonstrate its practical performance via numerical experiments.</p>
