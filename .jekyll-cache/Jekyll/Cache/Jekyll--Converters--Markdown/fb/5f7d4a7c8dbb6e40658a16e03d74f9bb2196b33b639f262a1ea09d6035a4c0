I"¾<p>Ed Schmerling is a roboticist pursuing a Ph.D. with the Institute for Computational &amp; Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University. He received a B.S. in Mathematics (with Honors) and Physics from Stanford in 2010.</p>

<p>Edâ€™s research interests span questions in robot motion planning and decision making under uncertainty -â€”â€‰how to model a robotâ€™s interaction with its (possibly-sentient) environment, how to efficiently plan actions by closing the loop on only the most relevant data to the task at hand, how to quantify/certify the performance of these algorithms.</p>

<p>In a previous life, Ed was a captain and coach of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the menâ€™s ultimate frisbee B-team and a force to be feared in regional competition. Nowadays heâ€™s hung up the cleats unless rival labs are looking to further their higher education.</p>
