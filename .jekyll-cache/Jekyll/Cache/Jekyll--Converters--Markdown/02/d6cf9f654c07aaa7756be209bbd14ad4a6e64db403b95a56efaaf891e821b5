I"ª<p>We have just published Problem 0 for homework 3. This demo is very straight forward, and it is to show you how to get the entire robot ‚Äúup and running‚Äù.
We have a few fully built robots ready for this and will be available for today‚Äôs ROS office hours. Drop by when you can. No need to sign up.</p>

<p>We apologise for the delay, as we ran into some issues building the robots, but we expect to have them all ready by next week.</p>
