I"£<p>The goal of this homework is to familiarize you with EKF and EKF SLAM for localization and mapping. You will also take a deeper dive into ROS and use some of the off-the-shelf tools. You will also be required to write your own nodes from scratch and start preparing code that will be useful for your final project.</p>
