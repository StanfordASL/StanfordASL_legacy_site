I"ø<p>Kiril Solovey is a roboticist specializing in multi-robot systems and their applications to smart mobility. He is currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, working with Marco Pavone, where he is supported by the Center for Automotive Research (CARS). He obtained a PhD in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University, where he was advised by Dan Halperin.</p>

<p>Kirilâ€™s research focuses on the design of effective control and decision-making mechanisms to allow multi-robot systems to tackle complex problems for the benefit of the society. His work draws upon ideas that span across the disciplines of engineering, computer science, and transportation science, to develop scalable optimization approaches with substantial guarantees regarding quality and robustness of the solution. For his work he received multiple awards, including the Clore Scholars and Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowships, best paper awards and nominations (at Robotics: Science and Systems, International Conference on Robotics and Automation, International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent System, and European Control Conference), and teaching awards.</p>

<p>In addition to his academic interests, he takes pleasure in being outdoors (mountain biking and hiking), traveling around the world, and enjoys food, cooking, music, books, and meditation.</p>
