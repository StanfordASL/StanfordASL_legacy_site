I"ˆ<p>Autonomous vehicles, in recent years, quickly became one of the most popular research topics in transportation. Several scientists proposed a vision in which shared autonomous vehicles fleets would be used instead of privately owned cars and would serve the current transportation demand with an extremely reduced number of vehicles. However, the implications that such a dramatic change of paradigm would have on transportation planning itself, were neglected almost entirely so far. Multi-modal simulation tools have been enhanced to accommodate autonomous vehicles travel but, if automation will actually help shared mobility becoming prevalent, more changes to current planning approaches will be needed. We might need to look at different sets of problems, and further enhance the models we use in order to solve them. This talk, points at some simple but important aspects of individualsâ€™ travel behavior that imply inherent limitations of existing approaches.  It also proposes ideas to adapt existing tools, or develop new ones, more suitable for a world in which autonomous shared vehicles would be the backbone of the transportation system.</p>
