I"!<p>Problem 4 is released (Problem 0 to come). Please download the latest copy of hw3.pdf.
Problem 4 is open-ended, and is designed to make you start thinking more about the final project and what you are capable of as a roboticist!</p>

<p>An update on the robots and problem 0:
The TAs have been working tirelessly over the past week to get your robots up and running (all 20 of them!). It takes about 4 hours to build each one.
We plan on releasing some of the robots (roughly 10) tomorrow, and hopefully the rest on Thursday.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that each robot is worth more than $5000 each, and is composed of delicate hardware. It is extremely important that you adhere to proper usage.</p>

<p>We will notify the class when each “robot batch” is released, as well as Problem 0.</p>
