I"<p>The Final Project is scheduled for Thursday March 14th. Groups will sign up for time slots during that day. Selected groups, based on performance, will be invited to a special demo event at <a href="https://cars.stanford.edu/">Center for Automotive Research at Stanford</a> (CARS) on Friday afternoon March 15th. Industry affiliates will be present at the event and will act as judges for the event.</p>

<p>This Wednesday’s lecture (Feb 13th) will be moved to Thursday 1:30 - 2:50PM in 420-041 (same room).</p>

<p>For homework 2 part 2 submission, when zipping up your files, do not include the datasets files and retrain_logs, otherwise the file becomes too large to submit on Gradescope.</p>

<p>The CMakeList.txt has been updated on the asl_turtlebot repo.
Please use the updated version for your homework. This resolves the “import asl_turtlebot.msg” error.
To avoid git issues, just copy and paste the CMakeList.txt in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanfordASL/asl_turtlebot/master/CMakeLists.txt">raw format</a>.</p>
