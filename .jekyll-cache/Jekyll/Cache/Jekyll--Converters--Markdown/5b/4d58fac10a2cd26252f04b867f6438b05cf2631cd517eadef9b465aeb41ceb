I"Ä<p>Thomas is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He completed his M.Sc. in Robotics at ETH ZÃ¼rich and his B.Sc. at EPFL, Switzerland. At ETH ZÃ¼rich, he worked on motion generation for legged robotics with Prof. Hutter, designed control algorithms for the student rocketry team, and worked on terramechanics for ESAâ€™s ExoMars rover at RUAG Space. He also interned at NASA JPL with Dr. Agha, where he developed resilient contact-based control algorithms for the DARPA SubT Challenge.</p>

<p>To enable autonomous systems to cope with uncertainty while guaranteeing safety, he is currently developing safe learning-based control and uncertainty-aware planning algorithms.</p>
