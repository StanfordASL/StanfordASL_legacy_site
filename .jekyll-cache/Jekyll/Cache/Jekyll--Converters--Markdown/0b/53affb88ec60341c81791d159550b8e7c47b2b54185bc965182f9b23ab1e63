I"À<p>Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to change the transportation landscape with safer, faster and more energy-efficient mobility. However 100% CAV penetration may never be achieved, raising the question of how to ensure a productive co-existence of CAVs with conventional vehicles while ensuring that the presence of CAVs benefits an entire traffic network. Using non-signalized intersections with such mixed traffic, the impact of CAVs on overall energy consumption has been investigated under different traffic conditions as a function of the CAV penetration rate (i.e., the fraction of CAVs relative to all vehicles). Results indicate that the energy efficiency improvement becomes more significant as the CAV penetration rate increases, while the significance diminishes as traffic becomes heavier. At a larger scale, we also find that a small fraction of CAVs can benefit non-CAVs, which raises interesting incentive-related questions.</p>
