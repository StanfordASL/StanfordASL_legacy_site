I"À<p>Benoit is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He received a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (minoring in Science, Technology and Society). At MIT, Benoit conducted research on planning and control for small aerial vehicles under the supervision of Professor Russ Tedrake. He was later responsible for control systems development at 3D Robotics. Generally speaking, Benoitâ€™s research attempts to leverage computational breakthroughs (e.g. autodiff, modern solvers, GPUâ€™s) to address the problems of planning and control for complex robotic systems. He is particularly interested in aerial robotics and systems that make and break contact with their environments.</p>
