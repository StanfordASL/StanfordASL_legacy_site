I"˛<p>Office hours for week 10 will be held in Skilling.</p>

<h4 id="demo-day-logistics"><strong>Demo day logistics</strong></h4>
<p>You should plan for a 3 min presentation followed by a 10 min demo. Please sign up for a slot for your demo <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12u7L8p8qwx-4xPYzLP_0Vpln-qsofhjlY53ex-cESmI/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>here</strong></a></p>

<p>Try to find a time slot that works for as many people on your team as possible.</p>

<h4 id="delivery-logistics"><strong>Delivery Logistics</strong></h4>

<p>As you drive around the environment, you should log locations of objects that the detector detects (i.e., different objects that are in the COCO dataset that the detector was trained on).</p>

<p>After the explore phase, we will ask you which objects you were able to log, and then request some of those items. The form of the request will come as a ROS string message to the topic ‚Äú/delivery_request‚Äù which will contain a string of object labels delimited by commas.</p>

<p>For example, a message might be: ‚Äúbanana,apple‚Äù. You can parse this string using string_name.split(‚Äò,‚Äô)</p>

<p>We have uploaded a script request_publisher.py to the asl_turtlebot github repo that asks for input and publishes the message in this form, feel free to use it for testing.</p>

<h4 id="detector-changes"><strong>Detector changes</strong></h4>

<p>We have fixed a bug in the distance estimation in the detector (see estimate_distance in the new files to see what changes were made). Additionally, we have added a more powerful CNN model to the jetsons (a 50-layer ResNet model), which performs better than the mobilenet model that we were using previously. We have updated the project branch to reflect these changes. Please read the README again.</p>

<p>For more details on how to incorporate these updates into your code and Turtlebot, please refer to the email with subject ‚ÄúAA274 Announcement: (Important) Demo day logistics, delivery logistics, detector changes, remarks‚Äù for more details.</p>
