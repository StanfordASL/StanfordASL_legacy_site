I"Ÿ<p>Robert is currently pursing a PhD in the Aeronautics and Astronautics
Department at Stanford University. He received a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering
(with Honors) from UCLA in 2018.</p>

<p>Robertâ€™s research interests include behavior modeling and planning optimization
in robotics â€“ how to incorporate known structure into statistical models
describing the behavior of others and how to efficiently, and in real-time, plan
optimally with those models. He is interested in designing new algorithms that
perform well in practice and are computationally efficient.</p>

<p>When not in the lab, Robert is out running or reading, but very rarely at the
same time.</p>
