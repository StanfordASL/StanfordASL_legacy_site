          <h3>Description</h3>
          <!-- <p>Details on the final project will be published later.</p> -->
          <p> Your robot is on an autonomous rescue mission! You will be expected to (1) explore an unknown environment and locate all of the objects around the world, then (2) given a rescue request from your TAs, your robot will need to <strong>autonomously</strong> rescue the objects and deliver them safely back to the home base. See this <a href="/aa274a/pdfs/project/AA274A_Final_Project.pdf">handout</a> for details about the deliverables, baselines, extensions and rubric.</p>
